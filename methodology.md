## Repeatable Step by Step Process

* OSINT \(if applicable\)
* Scan for open ports and research them to further enumerate the services 
* Enumerate the services as much as possible and write down anything potentially useful
* Research potential vulnerabilities for found services
* Exploit the target and create persistence
* Loot the machine and move throughout the network if within scope
