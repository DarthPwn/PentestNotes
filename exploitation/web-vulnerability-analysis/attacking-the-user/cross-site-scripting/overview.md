# Overview

## Overview

XSS is an attack that let's the attacker execute javascript code in the browser of the victim.

## What's the Worst That Can Happen?

1. Complete control over the browser. The attacker can access plugins, like password managers. The attacker can trick the user into allowing webcam or audio.
2. Session-hijacking/Cookie theft. This is when the attacker steals the cookie that is saved in the browser. The attacker can log in to the service as the victim, and gain access to the account.
3. The attacker can execute a keylogging-script that steals everything the user inputs in the website.
4. Phishing. The attacker can insert a fake login.
5. Browser exploits. The script can redirect to a another page that issues an attack against the browser, possibly leading to total takeover of the machine.

## Types of XSS

### Persistent

* The attacker has managed to insert malicious code into the database. So every time the database serves that data the script will me executed. Most dangerous XSS.

### Reflected

* Code comes off of the web application \(like the comments section\) and attacks the users browser

### DOM based

* URL based attack. Look more into this.
