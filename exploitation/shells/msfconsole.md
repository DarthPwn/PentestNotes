#to see the options use generate -h
```

## If Meterpreter Goes In and Out, Change Payload

```bash
set payload linux/x86/
```

* switch to staged or non staged

## Staged Payloads

* they will have /meterpreter/ in front of payload

## Non-Staged Payloads

* they will not have /meterpreter/

## Single Commands in Windows

### If there is Limited Space and Only a Single Command is Needed Use

```bash
use payload/windows/exec
```

```bash
use payload/cmd/windows/generic
```
