# Sitemaps

## Overview

* sitemaps are sometimes included within the website in order to help search engines to crawl and index their site
* the sitemaps also tell the search engines what webpages that should not be crawled \(from an attacker's standpoint, this is great\)
* robots.txt and sitemap.xml are the two main files to check during enumeration
