# Upgrade Non tty Shell

## Overview

* ff you have a non-tty-shell there are certain commands and stuff you can't do
* this can happen if you upload reverse shells on a webserver, so that the shell you get is by the user www-data, or similar
* these users are not meant to have shells as they don't interact with the system has humans do
* anyways, if you get one of these shells you can upgrade it to a tty-shell using the following methods

## Using Python

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' THIS MAY ALSO WORK
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'  ALSO TRY LIKE THIS
```

## Echo

```bash
echo 'os.system('/bin/bash')'
```

## sh

```bash
/bin/sh -i
```

## Bash

```bash
/bin/bash -i
```

## Perl

```bash
perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

## From within VI

```bash
:!bash
```

## Interactive tty-shell

* if you manage to upgrade to a non-interactive tty-shell you will still have a limited shell
* you won't be able to use the up and down arrows, you won't have tab-completion
* this might be really frustrating if you stay in that shell for long
* it can also be more risky, if a execution gets stuck you cant use Ctr-C or Ctr-Z without killing your session
* however that can be fixed using socat, follow these instructions
